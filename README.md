This is a fork of Goob Station, which itself is a fork of Space Station 14, named Monolith Station. To prevent people from forking RobustToolbox, a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on our specific server, and this is the content pack for Monolith Station.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.

## Documentation/Wiki

We do not have documentation, so use the [Goob Station Documentation](https://docs.goobstation.com/) which has documentation on GS14's content, engine, game design, and more. It also has lots of resources for new contributors to the project.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Get in [Monolith Station Discord](https://discord.gg/mxY4h2JuUw) if you want to help. Feel free to check the [list of issues](https://github.com/Monolith-Station/Monolith-Station/issues) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help either!
While following the [Space Station 14 Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/codebase-info/pull-request-guidelines.html) is not mandatory for Monolith Station, we recommend reviewing them for best practices.

We are not currently accepting translations of the game on our main repository. If you would like to translate the game into another language consider creating a fork or contributing to a fork.
