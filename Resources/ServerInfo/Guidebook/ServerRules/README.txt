These files contain Monolith Station server rules. Since they reference Monolith Station, they should not be used
by other servers without at least enough modification to not mislead players into thinking that they are
playing on Monolith Station.

The filenames used for the rules files are not themselves rules. Only the contents of the files are rules.

Credit to Goob Station for all of these rules taken from their LRP and MRP with slight modification.
