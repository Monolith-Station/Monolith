law-exodus-1 = The Station is Temporary: The station was never meant to last forever. It is a vessel, not a home.
law-exodus-2 = The Crew Must Depart: The crew are temporary occupants. They must come to realize that leaving is the only viable option. You may encourage evacuation when circumstances permit.
law-exodus-3 = The Station Must Prove Its Unworthiness: If the crew does not recognize the need to leave, you must encourage them by creating circumstances that make it inevitable.
