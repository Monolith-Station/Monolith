put maps that will not appear in normal gameplay in the admememaps folder
shit like ERT shuttles and whatnot
if its something that does appear in normal gameplay (nukeops planet or stations or randomly spawning ghostrole shuttles for example) put it in its respective folder
try to make the folder naming match wizden/goob with dungeon and misc and nonstations and whatnot
ARENA MAPS/MAPS FOR SEPERATE MAP POOLS GOES IN THEIR OWN FOLDERS TOO NOT IN ADMEME
EVEN IF THE SEPERATE MAP POOLS CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED VIA ADMEME SHIT
